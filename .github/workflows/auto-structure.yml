            This PR was created automatically.

            - Files moved using **git mv** (so diffs show clearly)
            - Standard folders created
            - `requirements.txt` refreshed (if Python files exist)
            - Verbose run log at `.github/auto-structure-log.txt`

            Review the moves and merge if they look good.
